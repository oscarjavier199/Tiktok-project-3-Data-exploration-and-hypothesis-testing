# TikTok Project III: Data exploration and hypothesis testing**

## Overview
**The purpose** of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze hypothesis tests, we will also apply descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing using Python.

*This Project has three parts:*

**Part 1:** Imports and data loading
**Part 2:** Conduct hypothesis testing
**Part 3:** Communicate insights with stakeholders

## Introduction
This is the third part out of 5 projects. The Final purpose of the projects is to develop a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying and predicting if a video posted by a TikTok user is either a 'claim' or an 'opinion', In this Project, we will explore the data provided and conduct a hypothesis testing.

## Data Sources
The datasets used in this analysis include:
- **Tiktok Dataset:** Provided by Google as part of the 'Advanced Data Analytics and machine learning Professional Certificate'.
